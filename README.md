Janggi is a korean variant of chess. The game can be played with the keyboard versus the computer. This project 
demonstrates the ability to display a game board, use multiple classes and have them interact, implement game logic for 
checkmate, create a play loop that alternates turns between players, and develop AI code for the computer's moves.
